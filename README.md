# command-line-simulator


## Description

command line simulator program developed by Mahmoud Dawod. The program simulates a command line environment where users can input various commands.

## Background

The command line simulator allows users to enter commands similar to those used in a regular command line interface. Users can input commands directly or provide a file containing a set of commands. Additionally, the program supports the execution of numbered commands entered by the user and provides a history feature to display previously executed commands.

## Usage

To use the command line simulator, you can enter commands directly into the program or provide a file containing a set of commands. The program will execute the entered commands and display the output accordingly. If you want to execute a specific numbered command, simply enter the command number preceded by an exclamation mark (e.g., `!a` to execute command number 'a').

Additionally, you can use the `history` command to display the history of previously executed commands.
